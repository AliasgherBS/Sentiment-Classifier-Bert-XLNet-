# Sentiment-Classifier-Bert+XLNet

The aim is to develop a model which would predict the sentiment (mood of the text) with higher accuracy into either of the two classes that is positive or negative.

Sentiment analysis is one of the leading applications of natural language text analysis, where it has been used in both business and research. It helps in identifying binary (0/1 or positive/negative) classification of a provided input. In this research, we used two classifiers, XLNet & Bert and merged their output with the linear regression model to test and achieve better results. We used the IMBD movie reviews dataset to train and test out our solution. The results conveyed that the XLNet algorithm alone works better than BERT and XLNet, BERT, Regression models.



Here are some practical examples of sentiment analysis:
 
1) Brand monitoring uses sentiment analysis to track how consumers feel about brands and their products.

2) Researchers put these analyzers together to understand how people view a particular thing.

3) Product Improvement collects information to determine what consumers are not satisfied or happy with.
